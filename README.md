# Multimodal Authentication & Product Recommendation System

## Project Overview

This project implements a User Identity and Product Recommendation System that uses multimodal authentication (facial recognition and voice verification) before providing personalized product recommendations.

**System Flow:**

1. User attempts to access the product prediction model
2. **Face Recognition**: System verifies user identity via facial recognition
3. If recognized, user proceeds to run a prediction
4. **Voice Verification**: System confirms the prediction through voiceprint verification
5. **Product Recommendation**: System displays the predicted product

The system uses pre-trained ML models to determine whether the face matches a known user, the voice is approved, and whether the prediction is allowed.

## Setup

**You'll need:**

- Python 3.8+
- A webcam (for face photos)
- A microphone (for voice recordings)

**Installation:**

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone <repo-url>
cd multimodal-data-preprocessing-assignment

# Set up virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create project folders
python scripts/setup_directories.py
```

## Data Collection (Everyone Needs to Do This!)

### Face Photos

Each person takes 3 photos with different expressions:

```
data/images/your_name/
├── neutral.jpg
├── smiling.jpg
└── surprised.jpg
```

**Tips:**

- Use your laptop webcam or phone camera
- Make sure your face is well-lit and clearly visible
- At least 640x480 resolution
- No sunglasses or masks

### Voice Recordings

Record yourself saying these two phrases:

```
data/audio/your_name/
├── yes_approve.wav
└── confirm_transaction.wav
```

**Tips:**

- WAV format preferred (16kHz or higher sample rate)
- 2-3 seconds per phrase
- Speak clearly, minimize background noise
- Use Voice Memos (Mac), Sound Recorder (Windows), or Audacity

### Task 1: Data Merge & Product Recommendation (Alice)

**Where to work:** `notebooks/01_data_merge_eda.ipynb` and `src/data_processing/merge_data.py`

**What to do:**

1. Download these datasets:

   - [Customer Social Profiles](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10up-WdC0a6egYaXLKiMQUotpOvaKZRZvYuWFQx4-RPQ/edit?gid=862127784#gid=862127784)
   - [Customer Transactions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s4WOVm49lmLQ8d9QbbbdgAcRTNh3m0KCH_5ciiaRZw0/edit?gid=1844409263#gid=1844409263)

2. EDA - explore the data:

   - Summary stats
   - At least 3 plots with labels (distributions, correlations, etc.)
   - Check for missing values, duplicates, data types

3. Clean and merge:

   - Handle missing values
   - Fix data types
   - Merge the two datasets (document your approach)
   - Save to `data/processed/merged_customer_data.csv`

4. Build a product recommendation model:
   - Use Random Forest, Logistic Regression, or XGBoost
   - Calculate accuracy, F1-score, and loss
   - Save to `models/product_recommender.pkl`

### Task 2: Image Processing & Face Recognition (Yassin)

**Where to work:** `notebooks/02_image_processing.ipynb` and `src/data_processing/image_processing.py`

**What to do:**

1. Collect 3 face photos from each team member (12 total)

2. Load and display the images

3. Image augmentation - apply at least 2 techniques:

   - Rotation (±15 degrees)
   - Horizontal flip
   - Grayscale conversion
   - Brightness changes
   - Adding noise

4. Extract features from the images

   - Save to `data/features/image_features.csv`

5. Train a face recognition model:

   - Use Random Forest, Logistic Regression, or XGBoost
   - Calculate accuracy, F1-score, and loss
   - Save to `models/face_recognition.pkl`

6. Test with both authorized and unauthorized faces

### Task 3: Audio Processing & Voice Verification (Brian)

**Where to work:** `notebooks/03_audio_processing.ipynb` and `src/data_processing/audio_processing.py`

**What to do:**

1. Collect 2 voice recordings from each team member (8 total)

2. Load and visualize:

   - Load audio files
   - Show waveforms
   - Show spectrograms

3. Audio augmentation - apply at least 2 techniques:

   - Pitch shifting
   - Time stretching
   - Background noise
   - Volume adjustment
   - Speed changes

4. Extract audio features:

   - MFCCs (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients)
   - Spectral roll-off
   - Energy
   - Zero-crossing rate
   - Save to `data/features/audio_features.csv`

5. Train a voice verification model:

   - Use Random Forest, Logistic Regression, or XGBoost
   - Calculate accuracy, F1-score, and loss
   - Save to `models/voice_verification.pkl`

6. Test with both authorized and unauthorized voices

### Task 4: Pipeline Integration (Cedric)

**Where to work:** `src/pipeline/authentication_pipeline.py` and `scripts/run_authentication_system.py`

**What to do:**

1. Integrate all three models:

   - Load the face recognition model
   - Load the voice verification model
   - Load the product recommendation model

2. Build the authentication flow:

   - Check face → if authorized, allow access
   - Run product prediction
   - Check voice → if authorized, show prediction
   - Handle rejections appropriately

3. Create a command-line app:

   - Takes face image as input
   - Verifies the person
   - Takes voice sample as input
   - Confirms the action
   - Shows product recommendation

4. Test everything:

   - Authorized users (should work)
   - Unauthorized face (should block)
   - Unauthorized voice (should block)

5. Record a demo video (3-5 minutes):
   - Show an unauthorized face being rejected
   - Show an unauthorized voice being rejected
   - Show a successful full authentication with product display

## Git Workflow

**Branch names:**

```
feature/data-merge              (Alice)
feature/image-processing        (Yassin)
feature/audio-processing        (Brian)
feature/pipeline-integration    (Cedric)
```

**Daily routine:**

```bash
# Pull latest changes
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create/switch to your branch
git checkout -b feature/your-task-name

# Do your work, then commit
git add .
git commit -m "Describe what you did"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin feature/your-task-name

# Create a Pull Request when ready
```

## Model Requirements

**All models must:**

- Use Random Forest, Logistic Regression, or XGBoost
- Report accuracy, F1-score, and loss

**Quick evaluation example:**

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, f1_score, log_loss

accuracy = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)
f1 = f1_score(y_true, y_pred, average='weighted')
loss = log_loss(y_true, y_pred_proba)
```

**Saving/loading models:**

```python
import joblib
joblib.dump(model, 'models/model_name.pkl')
model = joblib.load('models/model_name.pkl')
```
